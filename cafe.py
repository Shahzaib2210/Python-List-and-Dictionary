# Pseudo Code
1 - Create a List of items and named as menu = ["Coffee", "Pastries", "sandwich", "Cup Cakes"]
2 - Create dictionary stock with menu name as key and menu_item quantity as value.
3 - Create another dictionary price with menu_item name as key and menu_item price as value.
4 - Create a empty float variable total_stock = 0.0
5 - Run for loop on menu list - for item in menu:
6 - Get quantity = stock[item] & cost = price[item].
7 - Now apply formula total_stock = total_stock + quantity * cost
8 - Print total_stock_worth on screen.
